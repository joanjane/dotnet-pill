## Background about .NET Core vs .NET Framework

Back in the early 2000s, MS built .NET Framework. The framework was closed source and supported only Windows platform that mainly required VS and knowledge about MSBuild.

.NET Core was introduced in 2016 as a modern, cross-platform and open-source framework. It was designed with a Modular architecture and lightweight runtime and libraries.

In 2020, MS merged both platforms, becoming just ".NET".
